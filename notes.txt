board should be the centerpiece of where everything is stored


DO NOT OVEROPTIMISE!!! make something work, come back later and optimise, can use AI for that

keep gerbersocket logic separate - might be made to be reusable in the future 


Zones object
Sockets object
-> both extracted in a separate logic



class Board
-> center point of everything


class Router
-takes in the Zones, Sockets, 


today

implement resolutions everywhere 
 - [ ] routing  
 - [ ] board size
 - [ ] module positioning


 todo today


1. work through to make routing reliable with the new method
2. new object for buses, and tracks, with size properties
3. support the bus on the right side as well 
3. no routing in the corners (determined by the radius)
2. ensure the board can be resizable
