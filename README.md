## Create a virtual environement and install required libraries

1. Create a virual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

You must use Python version `3.11`, or lower, othewsie it won't work with some outdated dependencies (such as `gerbonara`). To control Python versions you may use the `pyenv` tool.

1. `brew install pyenv`
2. `pyenv install 3.11.0`
3. `pyenv global 3.11.0` to set globally or `pyenv local 3.11.0` to set in the current directory.

In the case this tools doesn't change your Python version (happens on an M-chip Mac), add `eval "$(pyenv init --path)"` to your ~/.zshrc and re-open the terminal.

## Running the server

Run the program with `python3 run.py`

## Editing the data, i.e. configurations, modules, etc.

See the [`/test_data`](./test_data) directory

## Progress and updates

See [CHANGELOG](./changelog) for latest updates and progress

## Idea in progress - JSON store information about each module for MakeDevice

A unique JSON file for each module which could be generated by a separate web application (could even annotate it there).

- Detect GerberSockets, and if there are none, have an option for an editor to add them? + keep-out zones
- Module description & name?
- Which layers it uses/how many 2/4
- Path/names for the `.wrl` files, gerbers, `.gltf`, and other
- Perhaps information about the 3D shapes, or its apertures
- EC30 size information
- Available services?
- Assign IDs
