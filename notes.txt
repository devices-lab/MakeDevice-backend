DO NOT OVEROPTIMISE!

fixes needed

- ensure no routing in the corners (determined by the radius)
- ensure the board can be resizable
- sometimes vias get placed close to existing traces - maybe place a horizontal margin length of 3 grids by bus wide span after a bus location is found?


imrovements preferable

- support the bus on the right side as well 
- diagonal traces do not work - check out other types of contraints in the pathfinder
- shorten the buses to a minimum?
