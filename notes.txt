DO NOT OVEROPTIMISE!

fixes needed

- ensure the board can be resizable
- via for grounf plane, and zone
- vias from the same net could have drill hole to close to each other on the same bus connection 
- move the corner zone logic to the board, instead of the busrouter
- zone positioning rouding errors Point: (45.0, 34.000001), Resolution: 0.25

- keep out zones of the Jacdac holes cannot overlap with the buses - shoves the routing around, and causes clearance issues 
        -> make the keep-out zones as small as possible on the to ensure no overlap
        -> make a keep out zone for the bus
        -> throw an error message when a keepout zone overlaps with the bus


On Saturday 
- ensure that for a net that has a copper fill (in this case the GND), that there is no bus created for it
- there is still issues with via clearance on the bus connections

General things to implement 
- point to point routing
- create a Router class if the functionality overlaps
- bom consolidation, checking for repetitive values (and replacing with the previous part number), reshuffling of reference designators

- cleanup the objects
- routing on inner layers

imrovements preferable

- merge/consolidate overlapping segments - hard to do properly!
- support the bus on the right side as well 
- diagonal traces do not work - check out other types of contraints in the pathfinder
- shorten the buses to a minimum after all connections are placed?
- implent so that any layer can be a plane?
- make it configurable to set which nets are to be routed with buses, and which to be routed with normal routing



From fronted to be corrected

- no need for manufacturing options
